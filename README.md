Just my shitty personal blueprints often heavily inspired by others
use at your own risk at clogging trains :)



# 68^2
Project 68^2 is my train based city block system. Im learnig how to use trains so bare with me :)

## City block components:
Heavily inspired by Leading-Medias-4569 base posted on reddit. Same block size and setup, just adapted for rigth hand train usage.
